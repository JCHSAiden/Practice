Make it so that all numbers below 21 in input say a
all numbers above 634 say b
all numbers that when multiplied by 2 are above 90 say c
Any time imput is between 22 and 44 they say d
35 says e
if x = 0 then print f
loop it
make sure there is a b string thats equal to 9 + x and if it is more than 15 then print oh darn heck
